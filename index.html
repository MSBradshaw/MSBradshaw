      <p>Michael began his PhD at CU Boulder in August 2019. He is part of <a href="https://layerlab.org/">Ryan Layer's lab</a> focused on Computational Genomics. Michael is interested in how computer science and improved algorithms can be used to leverage useful information from genomic data.</p>
      <p>Early in his undergrad at Brigham Young University, Michael worked with <a href="http://byutissueengineering.com/about-us/">Alonzo Cook</a> studying <a href="https://www.sciencerepository.org/realistic-murine-model-for-streptozotocin-induced-diabetic-peripheral-neuropathy_RGM-2-106">diabetic peripheral neuropathy</a>. During this time he realized his love for research but his loathe for wetlab, prompting his switch to bioinformatics research.</p>
      <p>Subsequently Michael researched with <a href="https://payne.byu.edu/">Samuel Payne</a>, investigating the use of machine learning and Benford's Law for detecting fraud in <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/757070v1">high-throughput biological data</a>.</p>
      <p>During the summer of 2018 and from January - August 2019 Michael interned with <a href="https://www.ice.mpg.de/ext/index.php?id=home0">The Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology</a> in the Ian T. Baldwin Lab. During this time he worked on elucidating the genetic control of microbiome recruitment of using qualitative trait mapping</p>
      <p>Michael also participated in numerous projects with the <a href="http://brg.byu.edu/">Bioinformatics Research Group.</a></p>
